# TrenchBoot hardware requirements

TrenchBoot by itself doesn't have any special requirements, just use the
requirements of target OS or hypervisor as a base. However, the same can't be
said about vendors DRTM implementation, and those differ between vendors.

## Intel

For Intel, you need a TXT-capable chipset and TXT-capable CPU. In addition, a
TPM is required. It shouldn't make a difference whether it is a discrete chip
(dTPM) or firmware TPM (fTPM) running in a CPU's trusted execution environment,
but version (1.2 or 2.0) must be supported by the processor, or more
specifically, the SINIT Authenticated Code Module (ACM) for given CPU family.
Refer to [Late Launch Overview](../dev-docs/Late_Launch_Overview.md) for more
information about the role and source of ACM.

Depending on firmware, TXT may need to be manually enabled in setup.

## AMD

On AMD, DRTM implementation is tightly connected to Secure Virtual Machine (SVM)
extensions. This is a virtualization technology included in all recent (last
decade or even longer) CPUs. Contrary to Intel, a discrete TPM (dTPM) is
required on AMD, but its version doesn't matter - the counterpart to ACM (which
must be signed by Intel) is implemented by TrenchBoot with support for both TPM
1.2 and 2.0.

Depending on firmware, SVM (which may be labeled also as virtualization or
AMD-V) may need to be manually enabled in setup.

## Caveats

While the above information summarizes requirements provided by respective
vendors, it doesn't necessarily mean that the platform meeting those conditions
will fully work. It is possible that the firmware doesn't initialize all of the
parts required by DRTM, or ACM is buggy, or there is an issue with microcode
that doesn't properly start a dynamic launch event. A list of such quirks can
be found [here](test_matrix.md/#hardware-quirks-and-workarounds).
