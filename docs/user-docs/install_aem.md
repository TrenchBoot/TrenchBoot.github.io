# Installing TrenchBoot AEM in Qubes OS

This document shows how to install Anti Evil Maid from packages produced by
3mdeb as part of [Trenchboot as Anti Evil Maid project](https://docs.dasharo.com/projects/trenchboot-aem-v2/).
If you wish to build the components yourself, please refer to documentation for
developers instead.

## Disclaimer

As of now, only legacy boot is supported. These instructions
<span style="color: red;">WON'T WORK under UEFI</span>. You have been warned.

## Installation

To install, you have to first add a new repository and import a public part of
a key that was used to sign RPM packages.

### Adding AEM repository

To add a new repository, create in dom0 as root `/etc/yum.repos.d/aem.repo`
with the following content:

```text
[aem]
name = Anti Evil Maid based on TrenchBoot
baseurl = https://dl.3mdeb.com/rpm/QubesOS/r4.2/current/dom0/fc37
gpgcheck = 1
gpgkey = https://dl.3mdeb.com/rpm/QubesOS/r4.2/current/dom0/fc37/RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem
enabled = 1
```

The key specified in the file must be downloaded and imported to RPM:

```bash
qvm-run --pass-io sys-net \
    'curl -L https://dl.3mdeb.com/rpm/QubesOS/r4.2/current/dom0/fc37/RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem' \
    > RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem
sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem
```

Now it should be possible to download and install packages from AEM repository.

### Installing prerequisite packages

As some of the packages are also available in standard QubesOS repositories,
potentially in newer versions, those must be temporarily disabled during
invocation of `qubes-dom0-update`, as shown in the following commands. If any
of the packages that are part of AEM are updated in standard repos, you will
have to choose between using new versions or having working AEM, at least until
new AEM release is published or the code gets merged upstream. If you decide to
restore AEM after an update broke it, you will have to repeat the installation
of overwritten package with `--action=reinstall` added to `qubes-dom0-update`,
if it wasn’t present before.

Start by installing prerequisite packages. Those are not part of newly added
repository, but `qubes-dom0-current-testing`:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-current-testing \
    oathtool \
    openssl \
    qrencode \
    tpm-extra \
    trousers-changer \
    tpm-tools
```

Next set of new packages comes from AEM repository, to avoid conflicts other
repositories are disabled for this call:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem \
    grub2-tools-extra \
    secure-kernel-loader
```

This is followed by reinstalling additional packages. A reinstall is required
because currently installed version is equal (or it may be higher in the future)
than those provided by AEM.

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem --action=reinstall \
    python3-xen \
    xen \
    xen-hypervisor \
    xen-libs \
    xen-licenses \
    xen-runtime \
    grub2-common \
    grub2-pc \
    grub2-pc-modules \
    grub2-tools \
    grub2-tools-minimal
```

### Updating GRUB

Booting on legacy systems (AEM currently doesn’t support UEFI) requires manual
installation of GRUB2 to the MBR of disk where Qubes OS is stored. In the
example below it is `/dev/sda`, yours may be different. Remember that GRUB2
must be installed on disk and not on partition, so don’t use `sda1`, `nvme0n1p1`
etc.

```bash
sudo grub2-install /dev/sda
```

### Installing main AEM package

Finally, `anti-evil-maid` package may be installed:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem anti-evil-maid
```

## Provisioning

All packages are in place. Before we can proceed with provisioning AEM, the TPM
must be cleared in the BIOS. Some platforms may require disabling Intel Trusted
Execution Technology (TXT) in order to clear TPM. After you clear the TPM,
remember to enable Intel TXT back, otherwise AEM will not work. Once TPM is
cleared, perform the TPM setup:

```bash
sudo anti-evil-maid-tpm-setup
```

![](../img/qubes_aem_setup.png)

You will be prompted to set the SRK password, it is a password to access TPM’s
nonvolatile storage where the AEM secrets will be sealed. If you failed to
clear the TPM, you will be shown a message like this:

![](../img/qubes_aem_setup_fail.png)

In that case, try clearing the TPM and run `sudo anti-evil-maid-tpm-setup`
again.

Now all that's left is proper installation of AEM. There are different options,
refer to `anti-evil-maid-install -h` for examples. In the simplest case, AEM is
installed on boot partition (not disk, i.e. `sda1` instead of `sda` etc.) of
Qubes OS. This can be done with a simple command:

```bash
sudo anti-evil-maid-install /dev/sda1
```

![](../img/qubes_aem_install.png)

After that, reboot the platform. On first boot you will be asked for SRK
password, followed by another question for disk encryption password, after which
a screen mentioning absent secret file will be shown:

![](../img/qubes_aem_1st_boot.png)

This is expected on the first boot after installation or an update to one or
more of measured components (GRUB, Xen, dom0 kernel and initramfs).
