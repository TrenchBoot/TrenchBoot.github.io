TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to
build security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their
systems. The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs)
that establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of
confidence that integrity actions were not subverted is derived.
