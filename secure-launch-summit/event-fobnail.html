The Fobnail Token provides reference open-source firmware for open-source
hardware USB devices, enabling a user/administrator for a
user/administrator/enterprise to determine the integrity of a system. To make
this determination, Fobnail functions as an attestor capable of validating
attestation assertions made by the system. As an independent device, Fobnail
provides a high degree of assurance that an infected system cannot influence
Fobnail as it inspects the attestations made by the system. Fobnail leverages
industry standards like TCG D-RTM trusted execution environment and IEFT RATS
to attest Dynamically Launched Measured Environments (DLME). During the
presentation, we will to share the current status and roadmap of the project.
