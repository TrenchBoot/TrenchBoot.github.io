Most of the modern platforms use Static Root of Trust to prove trustworthiness
of the running firmware and software. It requires an immutable piece of code
responsible for creating trustworthy first measurement and verification of the
boot code. The amount of requirements and safety measures makes SRTM very
complex and hard to implement correctly. That is why Dynamic Root of Trust has
been created. It allows to establish a secure environment for the measurement
of the running software at almost any time in the machine boot flow. This
presentation will show how easy it is to integrate a DRTM on both Intel and AMD
based machines. Presentation will also overview state of DRTM support on
non-x86 hardware to show full picture of the ecosystem. On the examples of Asus
KGPE-D16 and Dell Optiplex 9010 which do not support any hardware Static Root
of Trust technologies like Intel Boot Guard or AMD Platform Secure Boot, a DRTM
early launch will be presented.
