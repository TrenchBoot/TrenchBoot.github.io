With the ever-increasing number of platform security features, determining the
level of security provided by a given machine is not an easy task. For
cost-saving or market segmentation reasons, different tiers of devices may
implement different sets of security features. LVFS HSI aims to provide an
easy-to-understand indicator of a machine's security level that an average
consumer can parse and use. D-RTM (Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement)
improves the trustworthiness of a device without the inflexibility and
complexity of an S-RTM solution such as Intel Boot Guard or AMD HVB. This talk
will discuss the ideas behind LVFS HSI and how we can extend it with D-RTM
compliance tests.
